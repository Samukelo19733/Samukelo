Still a lot of work needed. For instance, I would have loved to make use of the GCBASIC *.dat files to dynamically update such things as the pins in the pulldown menus of snippets.
PID Kp, Ki, Kd to be linked to the analog pins.
Perhaps I posted prematurely, I have not yet even tested these snippets physically, myself. May be I should have verified them first.
I could not change the compiler from XC8, and AVR-Dude, under "Tools", to GCBAsic. And lots of other issues!
